# Day-2-Progress-Steps
Day 2 of 50 Projects in 50 Days. Hatch and evolve a Pokemon! All pixel sprites © 2022 Pokémon. © 1995–2022 Nintendo/Creatures Inc./GAME FREAK inc. Pokémon

Inititally I felt this project was too visually simple to stand on its own, so I made it into a simple Pokemon evolution simulator.
I wasted a bit of time overthinking ways to make the images change along with the progress bar, but I ended up going with a solution that
I was confident would work -- and thankfully, it did (see the chunk of "if else"s at the bottom of my update() function). This project was 
mostly a review of things I already know, but I'm glad it gave me an opportunity to practice. I would love to add pixel borders to the 
text boxes and buttons, so I will definitely revisit this project in the future.
